\chapter{Data Processing Examples}
\label{ch:examples}

\definecolor{lgray}{gray}{0.95}

This chapter showcases a variety of results that are possible when
processing different data sets with the Stereo Pipeline. It is also a
shortened guide that shows the commands used to process specific
mission data. There is no definitive method yet for making elevation
models as each stereo pair is unique. We hope that the following
sections serve as a cookbook for strategies that will get you started
in processing your own data. We recommend that you second check your
results against another source.

\section{Guidelines for Selecting Stereo Pairs}

When choosing image pairs to process, images that are taken with
similar viewing angles, lighting conditions, and significant surface
coverage overlap are best suited for creating terrain
models. Depending on the characteristics of the mission data set and
the individual images, the degree of acceptable variation will
differ. Significant differences between image characteristics
increases the likelihood of stereo matching error and artifacts, and
these errors will propagate through to the resulting data products.

Although images do not need to be map-projected before running the
\texttt{stereo} program, we recommend that you do run {\tt cam2map}
(or \texttt{cam2map4stereo.py})
beforehand, especially for image pairs that contain large topographic
variation (and therefore large disparity differences across the
scene, e.g., Valles Marineris).  Map-projection is especially necessary
when processing \ac{HiRISE} images. This removes the large disparity
differences between \ac{HiRISE} images and leaves only the small
detail for the Stereo Pipeline to compute. Remember that \ac{ISIS}
can work backwards through a map-projection when applying the camera
model, so the geometric integrity of your images will not be sacrificed
if you map-project first.

An alternative way of map-projection, that applies to non-ISIS imagery
as well, is with the \texttt{mapproject} tool (section
\ref{mapproj-example}).

Excessively noisy images will not correlate well, so images should be
photometrically calibrated in whatever fashion suits your purposes. If
there are photometric problems with the images, those photometric
defects can be misinterpreted as topography.

Remember, in order for \texttt{stereo} to process stereo pairs in
\ac{ISIS} cube format, the images must have had SPICE data associated
by running ISIS's \texttt{spiceinit} program run on them first.

%% \subsection{Comparing Examples to your System}

%% Since our first release we re-performed some of these examples and
%% recorded their processing time so you the user can judge how long it
%% will take you. Our examples were processed on our server called
%% `Lunokhod 2'. This server is a Dell PowerEdge Rack 900 purchased in
%% late 2009. Below are its specifications:

%% \begin{center}
%% \begin{tabular}{ l | l }
%% CPU & Dual E7420 Xeon at 2.13 GHz \emph{(16 logical cores)} \\ \hline
%% FSB & 1066 MHz \\ \hline
%% L2 Cache & 8 MB \\ \hline
%% Memory & 64 GB @ 667 MHz (mis-matched?) \\ \hline
%% Storage & Local RAID5 \\ \hline
%% OS & Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 \\ \hline
%% BogoMIPS & 4256 \\ \hline
%% Color & Dell Graphite \\
%% \end{tabular}
%% \end{center}

%% The times recorded are listed in wall hours and CPU hours. Wall-hours
%% are how long it took the job to complete from the user's
%% perspective. CPU-hours are how much processing time it took to
%% complete. If the job took 30 wall-minutes on a 2 core system, it spent
%% 30 minutes in CPU 1 and CPU 2. Thus, the total CPU-hours would be
%% 1. This example, though correct, is not what always happens in the
%% real world. Inefficiency with managing multiple threads or the
%% complete lack of multithreaded code will bring wall hours up to CPU
%% hours. Your required CPU hours will vary based on CPU
%% architecture. Estimating your required CPU hours for your system can
%% be done by scaling with the BogoMIPS measurements. This can be read
%% from Linux systems with the command: \texttt{cat /proc/cpuinfo}

\section{Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE}

\ac{HiRISE} is one of the most challenging cameras to use when making 3D
models because \ac{HiRISE} exposures can be several gigabytes each. Working
with this data requires patience as it will take time.

One important fact to know about HiRISE is that it is composed of
multiple linear CCDs that are arranged side by side with some vertical
offsets. These offsets mean that the CCDs will view some of the same
terrain but at a slightly different time and a slightly different
angle. Mosaicking the CCDs together to a single image is not a simple
process and involves living with some imperfections.

One cannot simply use the \ac{HiRISE} RDR products, as they do not
have the required geometric stability.  Instead, the \ac{HiRISE}
EDR products must be assembled using \ac{ISIS} \texttt{noproj}.
The USGS distributes a script in use by the \ac{HiRISE} team that
works forward from the team-produced `balance' cubes, which provides
a de-jittered, noproj'ed mosaic of a single observation, which is
perfectly suitable for use by the Stereo Pipeline (this script was
originally engineered to provide input for SOCET SET).  However,
the `balance' cubes are not available to the general public, and
so we include a program (\texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py}, written in
\href{http://www.python.org}{Python}) that will take \ac{PDS}
available \ac{HiRISE} EDR products and walk through the processing
steps required to provide good input images for \texttt{stereo}.

The program takes all the red CCDs and projects them using the \ac{ISIS}
{\tt noproj} command into the perspective of the RED5 CCD. From there,
{\tt hijitreg} is performed to work out the relative offsets between
CCDs. Finally the CCDs are mosaicked together using the average
offset listed from {\tt hijitreg} using the {\tt handmos} command,
and the mosaic is normalized with {\tt cubenorm}.
Below is an outline of the processing.

\begin{verbatim}
    hi2isis           # Import HiRISE IMG to Isis
    hical             # Calibrate
    histitch          # Assemble whole-CCD images from the channels
    spiceinit
    spicefit          # For good measure
    noproj            # Project all images into perspective of RED5
    hijitreg          # Work out alignment between CCDs
    handmos           # Mosaic to single file
    cubenorm          # Normalize the mosaic
\end{verbatim}

To use our script, first download a set of HiRISE data. Here is
an example, using wget to fetch all RED CCDs for a dataset and
process them.

\begin{verbatim}
  wget -r -l1 -np \
    "http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EDR/ESP/ORB_029400_029499/ESP_029421_2300/" \
    -A "*RED*IMG"
\end{verbatim}

Alternately, you can pass the \texttt{-\/-download-folder} option to
\texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py} and pass in the url of the web page containing the EDR
files as the only positional argument.  This will cause the tool to first download
all of the RED CCD images to the specified folder and then continue with processing.

\begin{verbatim}
  hiedr2mosaic.py --download-folder hirise_example/
    http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EDR/ESP/ORB_029400_029499/ESP_029421_2300/
\end{verbatim}

Assuming you downloaded the files manually, go to the directory containing the files. You can run the
\texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py} program without any arguments to view a short
help statement, with the \texttt{-h} option to view a longer help statement,
or just run the program on the EDR files like so:

\begin{verbatim}
    hiedr2mosaic.py *.IMG
\end{verbatim}

If you have more than one observation's worth of EDRs in that
directory, then limit the program to just one observation's EDRs
at a time, e.g. \texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py PSP\_001513\_1655*IMG}.  If you
run into problems, try using the \texttt{-k} option to retain all of
the intermediary image files to help track down the issue.  The
\texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py} program will create a single mosaic file
with the extension \texttt{.mos\_hijitreged.norm.cub}.  Be warned that
the operations carried out by \texttt{hiedr2mosaic.py} can take many
hours to complete on the very large HiRISE images.

An example of using ASP with HiRISE data is included in the
\texttt{examples/HiRISE} directory (just type 'make' there).

\subsubsection*{stereo.default}

The stereo.default example file (appendix \ref{ch:stereodefault})
should apply well to HiRISE. Just set
\texttt{alignment-method} to \texttt{none} if
using map-projected imagery. If you are not using map-projected
imagery, set \texttt{alignment-method} to \texttt{homography} or
\texttt{affineepipolar}. The \texttt{corr-kernel} value can usually be
safely reduced to 21 pixels to resolve finer detail and faster
processing for images with good contrast.

\section{Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CTX}

\ac{CTX} is a moderate camera to work with. Processing times for
\ac{CTX} can be pretty long when using Bayes EM subpixel
refinement. Otherwise the disparity between images is relatively
small, allowing efficient computation and a reasonable processing time.

\subsection{North Terra Meridiani}

%% \begin{tabular}{l r c r c}
%% \textit{Processing in Stereo:} & Wall Time & \texttt{13:28:04.00} & CPU Time & \texttt{45:54:50.10} \\
%% \end{tabular}

In this example, we use map-projected images. Map-projecting the
images is the most reliable way to align the images for
correlation. However when possible, use non-map-projected images with
the \texttt{alignment-method affineepipolar} option. This greatly reduces
the time spent in triangulation. For all cases using linescan cameras,
triangulation of map-projected images is 10x slower than
non-map-projected images.

This example is distributed in the \texttt{examples/CTX} directory (type
'make' there to run it).

\section{Mars Global Surveyor MOC-NA}

In the Stereo Pipeline Tutorial in Chapter~\ref{ch:moc_tutorial}, we
showed you how to process a narrow angle \ac{MOC} stereo pair that
covered a portion of Hrad Vallis. In this section we will show you
more examples, some of which exhibit a problem common to stereo
pairs from linescan imagers: ``spacecraft jitter'' is caused by
oscillations of the spacecraft due to the movement of other spacecraft
hardware.  All spacecraft wobble around to some degree but some are
particularly susceptible.

Jitter causes wave-like distortions along the track of the satellite
orbit in \acp{DEM} produced from linescan camera images.  This effect can
be very subtle or quite pronounced, so it is important to check your
data products carefully for any sign of this type of artifact. The
following examples will show the typical distortions created by this
problem.

Note that the science teams of \ac{HiRISE} and \ac{LROC} are actively
working on detecting and correctly modeling jitter in their respective
SPICE data. If they succeed in this, the distortions will still
be present in the raw imagery, but the jitter will no longer produce
ripple artifacts in the DEMs produced using ours or other stereo
reconstruction software.

\section{Mars Exploration Rovers}\label{mer:example}

The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) have several cameras on board
and they all seem to have a stereo pair. With ASP you are able to
process the PANCAM, NAVCAM, and HAZCAM camera imagery. ISIS has no
telemetry or camera intrinsic supports for these images. That however is
not a problem as their raw imagery contains the cameras' information in
JPL's CAHV, CAHVOR, and CHAVORE formats.

These cameras are all variations of a simple pinhole camera model so
they are processed with ASP in the \texttt{Pinhole} session instead of
the usual \texttt{ISIS}. ASP only supports creating of point
clouds. \emph{The *-PC.tif is a raw point cloud with the first 3
  channels being XYZ in the rover site's coordinate frame}. We don't
support the creation of DEMs from these images and that is left as an
exercise for the user.

An example of using ASP with MER data is included in the
\texttt{examples/MER} directory (just type 'make' there).

\subsection{PANCAM, NAVCAM, HAZCAM}

All of these cameras are processed the same way. We'll be showing 3D
processing of the front hazard cams. The only new things in the
pipeline is the new executable \texttt{mer2camera} along with the use
of \texttt{alignment-method epipolar}. This example is also provided
in the MER data example directory.

this stereo pair does not contain the landing site.  It is slightly

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Commands}

Download the EDRs for the left and right CCDs for observations
M104318871 and M104318871 from \url{http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc/search}.
Alternatively you can search by original
IDs of 2DB8 and 4C86 in the PDS.

All ISIS preprocessing of the EDRs is performed via the
\texttt{lronac2mosaic.py} command. This runs \texttt{lronac2isis},
\texttt{lronaccal}, \texttt{lronacecho}, \texttt{spiceinit},
\texttt{noproj}, and \texttt{handmos} to create a stitched unprojected
image for a single observation. In this example we don't map-project
the images as ASP can usually get good results. More aggressive
terrain might require an additional \texttt{cam2map4stereo.py} step.

\begin{verbatim}
    ISIS 3> lronac2mosaic.py M104318871LE.img M104318871RE.img
    ISIS 3> lronac2mosaic.py M104311715LE.img M104311715RE.img

              result/output --alignment-method affineepipolar
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{stereo.default}

The defaults work generally well with LRO-NAC pairs, so you don't need
to provide a stereo.default file. Map-projecting is optional. When
map-projecting the images use \texttt{alignment-method none}, otherwise
use \texttt{alignment-method affineepipolar}. Better map-project results
can be achieved by projecting on a higher resolution elevation source
like the WAC DTM. This is achieved using the ISIS command \texttt{demprep}
and attaching to cube files via \texttt{spiceinit}'s SHAPE and MODEL
options.

\section{Apollo 15 Metric Camera Images}

\begin{tabular}{ r c r c}

\end{tabular}

Apollo Metric images were all taken at regular intervals, which means
that the same \texttt{stereo.default} can be used for all sequential
pairs of images. Apollo Metric images are ideal for stereo processing.
They produce consistent, excellent results.

The scans performed by ASU are sufficiently detailed to exhibit film
grain at the highest resolution.  The amount of noise at the full
resolution is not helpful for the correlator, so we recommend
subsampling the images by a factor of 4.

Currently the tools to ingest Apollo TIFFs into ISIS are not
available, but these images should soon be released into the PDS for
general public usage.

\section{Cassini ISS NAC}

This is a proof of concept showing the strength of building the Stereo
Pipeline on top of \ac{ISIS}.  Support for processing ISS NAC stereo pairs
was not a goal during our design of the software, but the fact that a
camera model exists in \ac{ISIS} means that it too can be processed by the
Stereo Pipeline.

Identifying stereo pairs from spacecraft that do not orbit their
target is a challenge. We have found that one usually has to settle
with images that are not ideal: different lighting, little perspective
change, and little or no stereo parallax. So far we have had little
success with Cassini's data, but nonetheless we provide this example
as a potential starting point.

\subsection{Rhea}

Rhea is the second largest moon of Saturn and is roughly a third the
size of our own Moon. This example shows, at the top right of both
images, a giant impact basin named Tirawa that is 220~miles across. The
bright white area south of Tirawa is ejecta from a new crater.  The
lack of texture in this area poses a challenge for our correlator. The
results are just barely useful: the Tirawa impact can barely be made
out in the 3D data while the new crater and ejecta become only noise.

\section{Digital Globe Imagery}
\label{digital_globe_data}

Processing of Digital Globe images is described extensively in the
tutorial in chapter \ref{ch:dg_tutorial}.

\section{RPC Imagery, including GeoEye, Astrium, Cartosat-1, and PeruSat-1}
\label{rpc}

Some vendors, such as GeoEye with its Ikonos and two GeoEye satellites,
and Astrium, with its SPOT and Pleiades satellites, the Indian Cartosat-1 
satellite provide only
Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC) models. Digital Globe provides both
exact linescan camera models and their RPC approximations and ASP supports both. 
Apparently such is the case as well for PeruSat-1, but ASP supports only 
the RPC model for this satellite. 

RPC represents four 20-element polynomials that map geodetic coordinates
(longitude-latitude-height above datum)
to image pixels. Since they are easy to implement and fast to
evaluate, RPC represents a universal camera model providing a simple
approximation to complex exact camera models that are unique to each
vendor. The only downside is that it has less precision in our
opinion compared to the exact camera models.

In addition to supporting vendor-provided RPC models, ASP provides a
tool named \texttt{cam2rpc} (section \ref{cam2rpc}), that can be used to
create RPC camera models from ISIS and all other cameras that ASP
understands, including for non-Earth planets (currently only the Earth, Moon
and Mars are supported). In such situations, the planet datum must be
passed to the tools reading the RPC models, as shown below.

Our RPC read driver is GDAL. If the command \texttt{gdalinfo} can
identify the RPC information inside the headers of your image files (whether
that information is actually embedded in the images, or stored
separately in some auxiliary files with a convention GDAL understands),
ASP will likely be able to see it as well. This means that sometimes we
can get away with only providing a left and right image, with no extra
files containing camera information. This is specifically the case for
GeoEye, and Cartosat-1. Otherwise, the camera files must be specified
separately in XML files, as done for Digital Globe images (section
\ref{rawdg}) and PeruSat-1.

For a first test, you can download an example stereo pair from GeoEye's
website at \cite{geoeye:samples}. When we accessed the site, we
downloaded a GeoEye-1 image of Hobart, Australia. As previously stated
in the Digital Globe section, these types of images are not ideal for
ASP. This is both a forest and a urban area which makes correlation
difficult. ASP was designed more for modeling bare rock and ice. Any
results we produce in other environments is a bonus but is not our
objective.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \includegraphics[width=2.0in]{images/examples/geoeye/GeoEye_ContextRender_400px.png}

\caption{Example colorized height map and ortho image output.}
\label{fig:geoeye-nomap-example}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Command}

\begin{verbatim}
   stereo -t rpc po_312012_pan_0000000.tif po_312012_pan_0010000.tif geoeye/geoeye
\end{verbatim}

If RPC cameras are specified separately, the \texttt{stereo} command
looks as follows. This example is for Mars, with the RPC models created
with \texttt{cam2rpc} from ISIS cubes.  So the datum has to be set.

\begin{verbatim}
  stereo -t rpc --datum D_MARS left.tif right.tif left.xml right.xml run/run
\end{verbatim}

For terrains having steep slopes, we recommend that images be
map-projected onto an existing DEM before running stereo. This is
described in section \ref{mapproj-example}. If the RPC coefficients are
not stored in the original Tif images, but rather in associated .RPB or
\_RPC.TXT files, \texttt{mapproject} creates
these files automatically for each map-projected image.

\subsubsection*{stereo.default}

The stereo.default example file (appendix \ref{ch:stereodefault})
works generally well with all GeoEye pairs. Just set
\texttt{alignment-method} to \texttt{affineepipolar} or
\texttt{homography}.


\section{SPOT5 Imagery}
\label{sec:spot5}

SPOT5 is a CNES (Space Agency of France) satellite launched on May 2002 and 
decommissioned in March 2015.  SPOT5 contained two High Resolution Stereoscopic 
(HRS) instruments with a ground resolution of 5 meters.  These two cameras were
pointed forwards and backwards, allowing capture of a stereo image pair in
a single pass of the satellite.

ASP supports only images from the HRS sensors on SPOT5.  These images come in
two parts, the data file (extension \texttt{.bil} or \texttt{.tif}) and the header file
the data file (extension \texttt{.dim}).  The data file can be either a plain 
binary file with no header information or a GeoTIFF file.  The header file is a 
plain text XML file.  When using SPOT5 images with ASP tools, pass in the data file
as the image file and the header file as the camera model file.

All ASP tools can handle \texttt{.bil} images (and also \texttt{.bip}
and \texttt{.bsq}) as long as a similarly named \texttt{.dim} file
exists that can be looked up. The lookup succeeds if, for example, the
\texttt{.dim} and \texttt{.bil} files differ only by extension (lower or
upper case), or, as below, when an IMAGERY.BIL file has a corresponding
METADATA file.

You can find a sample SPOT5 image at 
\url{http://www.geo-airbusds.com/en/23-sample-imagery}.

One issue to watch out for is that SPOT5 data typically comes in a standard
directory structure where the image and header files always have the same name.
The header (camera model) files cannot be passed into the \texttt{bundle\_adjust} tool with the
same file name even if they are in different folders.  A simple workaround is to create
symbolic links to the original header files with different names:

\begin{verbatim}
    > ln -s  front/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM front/SEGMT01/METADATA_FRONT.DIM
    > ln -s  back/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM  back/SEGMT01/METADATA_BACK.DIM
    > bundle_adjust -t spot5 front/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL back/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL \
      front/SEGMT01/METADATA_FRONT.DIM back/SEGMT01/METADATA_BACK.DIM -o ba_run/out
    > stereo -t spot5 front/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL back/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL  \ 
      front/SEGMT01/METADATA_FRONT.DIM back/SEGMT01/METADATA_BACK.DIM \ 
      st_run/out --bundle-adjust-prefix ba_run/out
\end{verbatim}

You can also map project the SPOT5 images before they are passed to the 
\texttt{stereo} tool.  In order to do so, you must first use the 
\texttt{add\_spot\_rpc} tool to generate an RPC model approximation of
the SPOT5 sensor model, then use the \texttt{spot5maprpc} session type
when running stereo on the map projected images.

\begin{verbatim}
    > add_spot_rpc front/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM -o front/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM
    > add_spot_rpc back/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM  -o back/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM
    > mapproject sample_dem.tif front/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL front/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM 
      front_map_proj.tif -t rpc
    > mapproject sample_dem.tif back/SEGMT01/IMAGERY.BIL back/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM 
      back_map_proj.tif -t rpc
    > stereo -t spot5maprpc front_map_proj.tif back_map_proj.tif  \ 
      front/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM back/SEGMT01/METADATA.DIM \ 
      st_run/out sample_dem.tif
\end{verbatim}

\section{Dawn (FC) Framing Camera}

This is a NASA mission to visit two of the largest objects in the
asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres. The framing camera on board Dawn is
quite small and packs only a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. This means
processing time is extremely short. To its benefit, it seems that the
mission planners leave the framing camera on taking shots quite
rapidly. On a single pass, they seem to usually take a chain of FC
images that have a high overlap percentage. This opens the idea of using
ASP to process not only the sequential pairs, but also the wider
baseline shots. Then someone could potentially average all the DEMs
together to create a more robust data product.

For this example, we downloaded the images

\begin{center}
\texttt{FC21A0010191\_11286212239F1T.IMG} and
\texttt{FC21A0010192\_11286212639F1T.IMG}
\end{center}

which show the Cornelia crater. We found these images by looking at the
popular anaglyph shown on the Planetary Science Blog
\cite{planetaryblog:vesta}.

\subsubsection*{Commands}

First you must download the Dawn FC images from PDS.

\begin{verbatim}

   --t_srs "+proj=eqc +lat_ts=-11.5 +a=280000 +b=229000 +units=m"
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{stereo.default}

The stereo.default example file (appendix \ref{ch:stereodefault})
works well for this stereo pair. Just set
\texttt{alignment-method} to \texttt{affineepipolar} or
\texttt{homography}.


\section{ASTER Imagery}
\label{sec:aster}

In this example we will describe how to process ASTER Level 1A VNIR
imagery. The data can be obtained for free from
\url{http://reverb.echo.nasa.gov}. Select a region on the map, 
search for AST\_L1A, and choose ``ASTER L1A Reconstructed Unprocessed Instrument Data''.
(The same interface can be used to obtain pre-existing ASTER DEMs.)

There are two important things to keep in mind when ordering the data.
First, at the very last step, when finalizing the order options, click on
``change'' and choose GeoTIFF as the data format, rather than
HDF-EOS. This way the imagery and metadata will come already extracted from the HDF file.

Second, note that ASP cannot process ASTER Level 1B imagery, as those
images lack camera information.

Below, we will use the dataset
\texttt{AST\_L1A\_00307182000191236\_20160404141337\_21031} near San Luis
Reservoir in Northern California. This dataset will come as a directory
containing TIFF imagery and meta-information as text files. We use the
tool \texttt{aster2asp} (section \ref{app:aster}) to parse it (also
there is described the data contained in this directory):

\begin{verbatim}
  aster2asp 030353697511879 -o out
\end{verbatim}

This command will create 4 files, named

\begin{verbatim}
  out-Band3N.tif out-Band3B.tif out-Band3N.xml out-Band3B.xml
\end{verbatim}

We refer again to the tool's documentation page
regarding details of how these files were created.

Next, we run stereo. We can use either the exact camera model
(\texttt{-t aster}), or its RPC approximation (\texttt{-t rpc}). The
former is much slower but more accurate. 
\begin{verbatim}
  stereo -t aster --subpixel-mode 3 out-Band3N.tif out-Band3B.tif \
     out-Band3N.xml out-Band3B.xml out_stereo/run
\end{verbatim}
or 
\begin{verbatim}
  stereo -t rpc --subpixel-mode 3 out-Band3N.tif out-Band3B.tif \
     out-Band3N.xml out-Band3B.xml out_stereo/run
\end{verbatim}

This is followed by DEM creation:
\begin{verbatim}
  point2dem -r earth --tr 0.000277777777778 out_stereo/run-PC.tif
\end{verbatim}

The value 0.000277777777778 is the desired output DEM resolution, specified in
degrees. It is approximately 31 meters/pixel, the same as the publicly available ASTER DEM,
and about twice the 15 meters/pixel image resolution.

Much higher quality results, but still not as detailed as the public ASTER DEM
can be obtained by doing stereo as before, followed by map-projection onto a coarser and smoother
version of the obtained DEM, and then redoing stereo with map-projected images
(per the suggestions in chapter \ref{tips}).
Using \texttt{-\/-subpixel-mode 2}, while much slower, yields the best results.
The flow is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  # Initial stereo
  stereo -t aster --subpixel-mode 3 out-Band3N.tif out-Band3B.tif \
     out-Band3N.xml out-Band3B.xml out_stereo/run               

  # Create a coarse and smooth DEM at 300 meters/pixel
  point2dem -r earth --tr 0.0026949458523585 out_stereo/run-PC.tif \
    -o out_stereo/run-300m

  # Map-project onto this DEM at 10 meters/pixel
  mapproject --tr 0.0000898315284119 out_stereo/run-300m-DEM.tif \
    out-Band3N.tif out-Band3N.xml out-Band3N_proj.tif            
  mapproject --tr 0.0000898315284119 out_stereo/run-300m-DEM.tif \
    out-Band3B.tif out-Band3B.xml out-Band3B_proj.tif            
  
  # Run stereo with the map-projected images with subpixel-mode 2
  stereo -t aster --subpixel-mode 2 out-Band3N_proj.tif out-Band3B_proj.tif \
    out-Band3N.xml out-Band3B.xml out_stereo_proj/run              \
    out_stereo/run-300m-DEM.tif

  # Create the final DEM
  point2dem -r earth --tr 0.000277777777778 out_stereo_proj/run-PC.tif
\end{verbatim}

Here we could have again used \texttt{-t rpc} instead of \texttt{-t aster}.
The map-projection was done using \texttt{-\/-tr 0.0000898315284119}
which is about 10 meters/pixel.

It is possible to increase the resolution of the final DEM slightly
by instead map-projecting at 7 meters/pixel, hence using

\begin{verbatim}
  --tr .0000628820698883
\end{verbatim}

or smaller correlation and subpixel-refinement kernels, that is

\begin{verbatim}
  --corr-kernel 15 15 --subpixel-kernel 25 25
\end{verbatim}

instead of the defaults (21 21 and 35 35) but this comes with increased noise as well, and
using a finer resolution results in longer run-time.

We also tried to first bundle-adjust the cameras, using ASP's \texttt{bundle\_adjust}.
We did not notice a noticeable improvement in results.
