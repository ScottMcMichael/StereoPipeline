1. Stereo Pipeline

The NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) is a suite of free and open source
automated geodesy and stereogrammetry tools designed for processing
stereo imagery captured from satellites (around Earth and other
planets), robotic rovers, aerial cameras, and historical imagery, with
and without accurate camera pose information. It produces cartographic
products, including digital elevation models (DEMs), ortho-projected
imagery, 3D models, and bundle-adjusted networks of cameras. ASP's
data products are suitable for science analysis, mission planning, and
public outreach.

Please install USGS ISIS version 3.5.0 if you would like to process
NASA non-terrestrial imagery. Users wishing to process Digital Globe,
GeoEye, or perspective imagery do not need to download anything else.

B. Credits

ASP was developed within the Autonomous Systems and Robotics area of
the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames Research Center. It
leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's (IRG) extensive experience
developing surface reconstruction and tools for planetary exploration,
e.g., the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions, and
rover autonomy. It has also been developed in collaboration with the
Adaptive Control and Evolvable Systems (ACES) group, and draws on
their experience developing computer vision techniques for autonomous
vehicle control systems.

See the AUTHORS file for a complete list of developers.

Complete details for how to reference ASP in your published works can be
found in the asp_book.pdf file, and in addition to the recommended references
there, in order to help you better cite the specific version of ASP that you 
are using in a work, we have started using Zenodo to create digital object 
identifiers (DOIs) for each ASP release.  Every new release of ASP will have 
its own unique DOI, which can be found at this URL: 
https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/714891
